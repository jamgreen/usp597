## Today's Class

1.  Analyze economic specialization and diversification
2.  What we can we surmise about the growth in our industries?
  + We will break down industry growth/decline to determine more about the regional dynamics that determine industrial change
3.  Calculating and interpreting shift-share analysis

# Specialization and diversification

##  What is it?

Regions' economies change over time and this has consequences for future growth and prosperity. Is your region dependent on one industry? Is it diversified? Is it especially competitive, or weak, in any industrial areas?

## Some Measures...Coefficient of Specialization

Popularized by Walter Isard, also known as the "Krugman Dissimilarity Index"

Basic idea-Halved sum of absolute deviations between regional and national shares across industries (basically a dissimilarity index)
- Reflects _share of regional employment that would have to be redistributed to match the national profile_

$$  Dis_{AB} = 1/2 * \Sigma \lvert a_i - b_i \rvert $$

a = share of employment for local location
b = share of employment for nation

Values range from 0 (perfect similarity) to 1 (perfect dissimilarity)

## Coefficient of Specialization (cont.)

There is also an index of localization that is the **sum** of absolute deviations of an industry across regions relative to overall employment

## Coefficient of Specialization (cont.)

## Hirschman-Herfindahl Index (HHI)

* Index used to measure industrial concentration (was primarily used in anti-trust cases historically)
* Sums the squared shares of parts within the whole
  + firms within industry
  + industries within region
  
$$ H = \sum_{i = 1}^{N} s_{i}^2 $$

## HHI Example (as borrowed from Wikipedia) { .smaller}

Assume we have 10 firms producing some good in a region. We shall assume that 3 of the firms produce 90% of the output and the remaining 10% is evenly distributed across the other firms.

In our second case let's assume one firm produces 90%.

Competitive (ish) market:<font size = "2.5"> $$ (0.30^2 + 0.30^2 + 0.30^2) + (0.014^2 + 0.014^2 + 0.014^2 + 0.014^2 + 
0.014^2 + 0.014^2 + 0.014^2) = 0.271 (27.1\%)$$</font>

## HHI Exmaple, Highly Concentrated Industry


Non-Competitive Market: $$ (.9^2) + 9 * 0.11^2 = 0.9189 (91.9\%) $$


From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herfindahl_index)

## Spatial Gini Coefficient

Gini coefficient is widely used measure of inequality

Variation along the "Lorenz Curve"- cumulative % of incomes

Ellison and Glaeser applied the idea to regional economies using the _sum of squared deviations from the reference region_

## Spatial Gini (cont.)

![](images/spatial_gini.png)

## Ellison and Glaeser Index (EG)

$$ EG = \frac{\Sigma (s_i - x_i)^2 - (1 - \Sigma_i x_i^2)H}{(1 - \Sigma_i x_i^2)(1 - H)} $$
s = industry employment share for subregion **i**

x = total employment share for subregion **i**

H = the industry Herfindahl-Hirshman Index

[Cassey and Smith](http://cru.cahe.wsu.edu/CEPublications/TB05/TB05.pdf) offer an example of how this works

## Analyzing Regional Economic Change

* A critical part of regional economic analysis is making sense of relative performance over time
* Location quotients can give us one view of this- which industries/occupations are more concentrated over time?
* More important question: Which sectors of the economy are driving regional growth (or decline)?

# Shift-Share Analysis

## What is Shift-Share?

- A technique that decomposes growth into different components:

> - National Growth- change that would have occured if the industry grew at the rate of the overall national economy
> - Industry Mix- the share of growth (or decline) due to concentration in partiular industries that are growing faster/slower than the economy as a whole
>-  Regional Shift- share of growth (or decline) attributable to "local factors"

## Shift-Share Analysis


National growth- share of regional job growth attributable to growth of the national economy

$$ NG_{ir}^t = E_{ir}^t-1 * (\frac{E_{US}^t}{E_{US}^{t-1}} - 1) $$

t = current time period 

t-1 = base year

i = specific industry 

r = specific region

## Shift-Share Analysis cont.

Industry Mix- How much growth can be attributed to the region's mix of industries?

$$ IM_{ir}^t = E_{ir}^{t-1} * [(\frac{E_{iUS}^t}{E_{iUS}^{t-1}}) - (\frac{E_{US}^t}{E_{US}^{t-1}})] $$
Where:

t = current time period

t-1 = base year

i = specific industry

r = specific region

## Shift-Share Analysis (cont.)

Regional (Differential) Shift
- How many jobs are created/not created as a result of the region's competitiveness?
- Identifies region's fastest growing industries compared to the nation
- Can help us form *better questions*

$$ RS_{ir}^t = E_{ir}^{t-1} * [(\frac{E_{ir}^t}{E_{ir}^{t-1}}) - (\frac{E_{iUS}^t}{E_{iUS}^{t-1}})] $$


Where:

t = current time period
t-1 = base year
i = specific industry
r = specific region

## LQ vs. Shift-Share

* LQs can tell us what industries comprise a larger share of economy today
  + Where are competitive/concentrated? What does our "portfolio" of industries look like?

* Shift-share is a more *dynamic* measure that let's us understand the components of economic change in our region
  + Is there some particularly unique aspect to your region that explains your industrial growth?
  
## Calculating Shift Shares

_Actual Growth_ = _National Growth_ + _Industry Mix_ + _Regional Shift_

$$ \Delta E_i = NG_i + IM_i + RS_i $$

Accounting relationship: total employment change can be decomposed into these components

**Caution** - For both LQ and shift-share, results can be very different for 3 and 4-digit NAICS levels
