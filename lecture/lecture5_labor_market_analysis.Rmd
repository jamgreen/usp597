## Check-in And Update

1. We are halfway through. How is everyone feeling? Is the R becoming easier to understand? What issues still puzzle you?

--

2.  As I mentioned on the website I will introduce PUMS over the next few weeks. The PUMS are *complex*, by design, and I do not expect you all to be experts, but being familiar with the potential microdata will take your analysis to next level. 

--

3.  Resources...is everyone making progress in DataCamp? Has anyone gone to the recommended guides in the syllabus ([R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), [R Graphics Cookbook 2nd Edition](https://r-graphics.org/))?

--

4. What can I do to make the labs/lectures more understandable or approachable?

# Introduction

##  Analyzing Your Regional Labor Market

--

* What sectors of the economy are people working in?

--

* What is the occupational composition of my regional workforce?

--

* How do occupaitonal wages compare in my region to the nation? What jobs are projected to grow?
