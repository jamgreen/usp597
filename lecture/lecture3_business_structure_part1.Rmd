# Check-In

## Regional Profile due April 14

- Employment growth (from BEA)
- Unemployment rates (BLS)
- Per capita income (BEA)
- GDP per capita (BEA)
- Poverty rate (Census/ACS)
- Educational attainment levels (Census/ACS)

# Analyzing Regional Business Structure

## Firms and Industry

Two broad issues in business structure:

- Type/Size of firm
- Industry structure

## Businesses/Employment by Size and Type

- Employment by _firm_ (enterprise) size:
  - [https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/susb.html](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/susb.html)
  - [https://www.sba.gov/advocacy/firm-size-data](https://www.sba.gov/advocacy/firm-size-data)
- Employment by _establishment_ size
  - County business patterns: [https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cbp/data.html](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cbp/data.html)
  - BLS QCEW: [https://www.bls.gov/cew/](https://www.bls.gov/cew/)
  
##  Firm vs. Establishment

- Firms are decisionmaking units
- Establishments are physical locations
- Multi-establishment firms:
  - retailers and chain restaurants
  - branch plant facilities
  - specialized units- R&D, sales etc
- Different establishments within firms may be coded directly, especially if in different locations

# Industrial Structure

##  Industry Employment

- The most common basis for analyzing regional economic structure
- Industry- what a particular worker (or establishment) makes/selss
  - Goods production 
    - Primary - agriculture, mining
    - Secondary - Manufacturing
  - Service Sector
- Generally, all workers in a particular "establishment" are generally counted in the same industry, regardless of what they do (occupation)

## Industry Coding

Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)- dominant system through the 1990s, replaced by NAICS in the early 90s. For historical industrial work, use SICs. But NAICS are now standard for North America (US, Canada, Mexico).

## NAICS 2-Digit Codes

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

naics <- tibble::tribble(
    ~Code,                                                            ~Industry.Title,

     "23",                                                             "Construction",
  "31-33",                                                            "Manufacturing",

     "51",                                                              "Information",
     "52",                                                    "Finance and Insurance",

     "72",                                          "Accommodation and Food Services",
     "81",                            "Other Services (except Public Administration)",
     "92",                                                    "Public Administration"
  )


kable(naics, booktabs = TRUE) %>% 
  kable_styling() 



```

## Industry Coding

The NAICS codes are hierarchical so the more digits a code has the more specific the industry. As with everything, the more detail we want, the less likely we are to find available data. Six-digit NAICS employment numbers are hard to find even for many large MSAs.

##  Other Sources

State Labor Market Information (LMI) offices carry many BLS data sources for the state. May not be able to get unprocessed data, but sometimes a good place to start.

## Some other notes { .columns-2}

- When possible, remember to measure at similar points in the business cycle
  - Peak to peak
  - Trough to trough
