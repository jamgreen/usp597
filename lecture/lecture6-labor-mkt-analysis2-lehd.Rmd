## Checking In

1. Any big questions regarding the course thus far?
2.  Next week is check in and preparing for our final projects. 
3.  What should we prioritize over the rest of the term?
    a.  Go deeper into microdata?
    b.  Focus more on R itself (go over conditionals, iterators, additional packages)
4.  What remains unclear? Or what can I do better?

# OnTheMap

## What is OnTheMap?

* A web-based census tool that shows where workers are employed and where they live
* Links data on where people work to data on where they live
* Hybrid data based on combining survey and administrative data with some additional modeling estimation and "fuzzing"
* Best Uses
    + Identifying small-area workforce characteristics
    + Mapping commuting patterns
  
## What is LEHD?

![LEHD Structure](images\lehd-structure.png)


##  Data Sources LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES)

* Job charactersitics from quartlery UI filing
* Residence characteristics from multiple federal agencies
* Job is counted if a worker is employed with positive earnings during the reference quarter, as well as one quarter prior
* Note the data are "synthetic"...they are modeled in order to protect confidentiality while maintaining accuracy

##  Geographic Details

* All states and DC have data available
* Base geography- 2010 Census blocks
    + allows you to sum upto different kinds of geographies (remember census geo-hierarchy)
  
##  Time Frame

Data are available from 2002-2015, but this coverage is *uneven*, some states don't have all years for all datasets (i.e. MA and DC)

Check [LEHD Documentation](https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/lodes/LODES7/LODESTechDoc7.3.pdf)

##  Database Structure

* Area Characteristic (AC)
    + RAC: Residence Area Characteristic data, jobs are totaled by *home* census block
    + WAC: Workplace Area Characteristic data, jobs are totaled by census block
    + OD: Origin-Destination data, job totals associated with both a home Census block and work Census block
  
  
##  Variables Available

* Age in three categories (29 or younger, 30-54, 55 and older)
* Earnings in three categories (<=$1,250/month, $1,250-3,333/month, >$3,333/month)
* 3 industry groups and 20 industry categories

##  Variables Available cont.

* Race/ethnicity and education
    + 6 race groups
    + Ethnicity, 2 categories
    + Educ attainment for two age groups, 30-54 and 55+
    + Less than HS, HS/equivalent, Assoc/some college, Bachelors or more
* Sex

##  Variables Available cont.

"Dominance": primary or non-primary

* Primary jobs = job earned the individual the most money
* The # of primary jobs = # workers
* Ownership: private or public (must calculate public employment)
* Firm age and firm size (only available 2011-newer for All Private Jobs)

##  Coverage

* Workers covered by UI system
    + *does not* include self+employed
* Federal workers added only recently (2010-2015)
    + means public employment figures are a bit questionable pre-2010
  
# OnTheMap Tools

## WAC/RAC Characteristics

* Worker Area Profile Analysis
* Home Area Profile Analysis
* Comparison tool
* Paired Area report

##  OD Tools

* Destination analyses
* Distance/Direction Analysis
* Inflow/Outflow


# IPMUS- Entry to Census Microdata

## IPUMS

It is possible to get PUMS data from Census directly...BUT [IPUMS USA](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/), a project by Univ. of Minnesota is a better tool

IPUMS offers US and International microdata surveys ranging from: ACS, CPS, ATUS (time use), NHANES etc

## IPUMS Abacus

An online tool and mobile app to query US microdata

Good for quick queries...bar tricks...impressing potential employers

## IPUMS Resources

Multiple videos to support using the website. Ex. [how to use the data extract system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZR0aDwr91s&feature=youtu.be)

[General FAQ/Tutorials](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/tutorials.shtml)

## Analyzing IPUMS Data in R

Anthony Damico has a website: [Analyze Survey Data For Free](http://asdfree.com/) with extensive instructions on analyzing complex survey data for free in R

## What do I mean by complex?

* These surveys are *weighted*
      + Have weights for individual observations to make representative of population
      + Include replicate weights (a series of additional weights to measure variance correctly)
* ACS microdata is *hierarchical*
      + contain *households* and *individual* weights
      + Depending on the question you need to account for both household and individual characteristics

## It's a lot...

Microdata is complex and requires a lot of work...but it is *worth it* and we have software to make this easier

You don't *need* to understand the math behind replicate weights, but you need to know replicate weights matter

##  Next Steps

This week register for the IPUMS website. Play with some of the online tools/abacus to see what you can get with it. 

Next week we'll have our check-in and Nick Chun will walk us through starting actual analysis in microdata
